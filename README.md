# GCP-Machine-Learning-API-Workshop

### Short Description
This tutorial is an introduction to extracting, classifying, and assessing sentiment for text from image documents using the Google Colab and the Google Cloud Platform API.

### Long Description
This workshop will review how to use Python, along with the Google AutoML API, to perform common machine learning and natural laanguage processing tasks using pre-trained models and methods. This workshop is designed to get researchers who are comfortable with python programming up and running with google cloud services for machine learning and natural language processing. 

In this workshop, participants will:

1) Set up a google cloud account and enable services from the vision and language AutoML Apis
2) Use AutoML vision and translation APIs to extract text transcripts from image, audio, and video files
3) Use AutomL languaage APIs to assessing sentiment and category for text documents

### Prerequisites

Participants should have basic introductory level Python programming skills, including the ability to write loops, conditionals, and methods. Familiarity with pandas is helpful but not required. 

### Setup and Configuration

Note: the free tier on all accounts below is sufficient for this workshop. 

To use the AutoML services for text extraction, categorization, and sentiment analysis, participants will need a Google Cloud Platform account.
